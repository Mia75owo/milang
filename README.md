# Milang

## Installation

```console
git clone https://github.com/Nils75owo/milang
cargo build --release
```

## Testing

```console
cargo test
```

## Using

As this project is in a very unfinished state, the compiler only reads from the
hardcoded `tictactoe.mil` file and directly invokes hardcoded compiler and linker
commands (found in `src/main.rs`).

```console
cargo run
```
